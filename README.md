## Introduction

AutoGL is developed for researchers and developers to quickly conduct autoML on the graph datasets & tasks. See our documentation for detailed information!

The workflow below shows the overall framework of AutoGL.

<img src="./resources/workflow.svg">

AutoGL uses `datasets` to maintain dataset for graph-based machine learning, which is based on Dataset in PyTorch Geometric with some support added to corporate with the auto solver framework.

Different graph-based machine learning tasks are solved by different `AutoGL solvers`, which make use of four main modules to automatically solve given tasks, namely `auto feature engineer`, `auto model`, `hyperparameter optimization`, and `auto ensemble`. 

Currently, the following algorithms are supported in AutoGL:


<table>
    <tbody>
    <tr valign="top">
        <td>Feature Engineer</td>
        <td>Model</td>
        <td>HPO</td>
        <td>Ensemble</td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">

This toolkit also serves as a platform for users to implement and test their own autoML or graph-based machine learning models.

## Installation
